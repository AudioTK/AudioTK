Audio ToolKit is a set of audio filters. It helps assembling workflows for specific audio processing workloads.

The audio workflow is split in independent components (without feedback loops) that consist of filters. 
Each filter has a set of synchronized input and output ports that can be connected together. All input 
ports must be connected, but not all output ports need to be.

Sampling rate can be independent between input and output ports, but input sampling rates are identical, 
and output sampling rates are also identical.

## Install

### Requirements

* C++17 compiler
* CMake
* Boost 1.75
* FFT library (for some filters like the fast convolution filter)
  * FFTW
  * IPP (default)
* Python with numpy (for Python support)
* Eigen (for some complex modules)
* libsndfile (for sound file I/O)

### Procedure

* Start CMake
* Configure your options
* Run make, Visual Studio or XCode

## Usage

### CMake

By setting ATK_DIR, you can import a package with FIND_PACKAGE(ATK) and components are supported. ATK_INCLUDE_DIRS and ATK_LIBRARIES are the main variables set, but each individual library can also be linked against instead of all of them.

Shared libraries and static libraries are different components (for instance Core and Core_static), by not setting components, all the shared libraries available will be stored in ATK_LIBRARIES. 

## Known Issues

* If a plugin uses the same buffers for input and output and the pipeline has two subgraphs, one from left to right and one to left (for instance), then they are processed in order and the second graph would use the result of the first branch. To fix this, add a BufferFilter just after the input filter so that they are all buffered and copied to an intermediate buffer when the first one is used. It adds a copy, so only use this fix when you have this specific configuration for a pipeline.
